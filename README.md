# CS178 Project 1 - Movie Manger - Ian Altekruse

## Project Summary
For my project, I created a movie manager website. Through my website, users can do the following...  
- Create a user with a username and password
- Login using that username and password
- Add movies to their watchlist
- View movies on their watchlist (along with other information pulled from the movies database, such as release date, revenue, etc.)
- Delete movies from their watchlist
- Change their password
- Logout

## Technologies Used
For this project, I used the following technologies...  
- Flask (for programming the website and routes)
- Python (for running code)
- AWS RDS (for hosting movies database)
- AWS EC2 (for hosting website)
- AWS DynamoDB (for hosting user information in NoSQL table)
- MySQL (for running queries to pull extra movie information)
